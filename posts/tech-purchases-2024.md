I have no shame in admitting I'm a victim of capitalism. I'm constantly torn between *"I should save money"* versus *"YOLO ing"* my way through life but these seven things I've bought? No regrets. As the price significantly outweighs the benefits or just the overall ease and convenience they bring to my life<br/><br/>

Of course, **[money can't buy you happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMxX-QOV9tI&ab_channel=JessieJVEVO)**, but if something can ever so slightly improve your life I think it's worth the **investment**. In no particular order, here are my best buys that I can't recommend enough.
1. **[YouTube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium)**: It had to be at the forefront of the list. I've lost count of how many years I've had YouTube Premium, and for good reason.
I owe my career, educational degree, replacing my squeaky door hinge, IKEA installations of products I was too daft to figure using just the manual, cooking and an endless list of things that I rely on YouTube for, YouTube Premium is worth every penny in my opinion. From what I have heard,those without Premium deal with multiple unskippable ads â€“ could never be me.
1. **[A password manager](https://www.doherty.co.uk/blog/the-benefits-of-a-password-manager/)**: I recently started using 1Password, and I cannot fathom the fact that I used to manage passwords manually â€“ trying to remember unique patterns and constantly resetting them.
Not only does 1Password sort all of my passwords I can use it to store confidential documents and it syncs effortlessly across my iOS, Windows, macOS, and Android devices. While I chose 1Password, any reputable password manager is worth the investment.
1. **[An electric toothbrush](https://amzn.eu/d/bz2FGw3)**: Electric `>>>` manual. I'm sorry I ever doubted a machines ability to match the precision I could achieve manually. This was an industrial revolution vs the stone age moment for me. My teeth feel cleaner and whiter. My only regret is being a skeptic and cheaping out and going for the cheapest brush and not splurging a bit of extra cash into trying to get a better more robust toothbrush - but we move.
2. **[Loop earbuds / Noise cancelling ear plugs](https://amzn.eu/d/fbGLNKc)**: I switched from constantly listening to music while working to using plain noise-cancelling ear plugs. In doing so, Iâ€™ve stripped away the last bit of joy in my life, leaving things as bland as chewing cardboard.
But honestly, itâ€™s not all bad â€“ I think Iâ€™ve slightly expanded my attention span, improved my ability to focus and feel more present. These ear plugs help reduce noise, not to an extreme level, but enough that I notice the difference when Iâ€™m not using them.
1. **[A really good work chair](https://amzn.eu/d/fMjre2s)**: This purchase genuinely blew my mind â€“ so much so that we ended up buying a quality chair for every member of my family. I had no idea how much of a difference a good chair could make to my workflow. At first, I tried to cheap out (like I did with the toothbrush) and bought the cheapest chair I could find on Amazon. Naturally, it broke in no time.My back didn't feel good, and I just couldn't sit in it comfortably for long. After that, I decided to invest around Â£100 in a better chair, and I havenâ€™t stopped raving about it since. Itâ€™s made a noticeable difference to my productivity, and my back is already thanking me. I've converted at least three of my friends to better chairs, and they all call me **Rabbi** now cause it's changed their lives.
2. **[Multiport charger](https://amzn.eu/d/jhStDY7)**: Stops me from trying to haggle charging ports for multiple devices. Really makes life easier and I don't have to struggle trying to hunt for endless charging ports for the plethora of devices that always seem to be running out of juice ðŸ¥¤.
3. **[Keyboard & mouse rest](https://amzn.eu/d/9BAIaUT)**: Carpel Tunnel Syndrome is very real. Do your wrists a favor and get some cushioning. Your future self will thank you, and youâ€™ll be able to spend more time passionately arguing on the internet instead of going outside and touching grass.

TLDR: Buy some quality stuff, don't cheap out on essentials that you use on the daily and maybe **[Jeff Bezos](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/)** isn't that bad after all (Okay, no one needs to have <em>that<em>much money!)
