I have no shame in admitting that I'm a victim of capitalism. I'm constantly torn between *"I should save money"* versus *"YOLO ing"* my way through life but these 7 things I've bought I have no regrets over these as the price significantly outweighs the benefits or just the overall ease and convenience they bring<br/><br/>

Of course, money can't buy happiness, but if something can ever so slightly improve your life I think it's worth the **investment**. In no particular order here are my best buys that I can't recommend enough
1. **[YouTube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium)**: It had to be at the forefront, I've lost count of how many years I've had Youtube premium and for good reason.
I owe my career, educational degree, replacing my squeaky door hinge, Ikea installations of products I was too daft to figure using just the manual, cooking and an endless list of things that I rely on YouTube for, YouTube Premium is worth every penny in my opinion. From what I have heard,those without Premium deal with multiple unskippable ads â€“ could never be me.
2. **[A password manager](https://www.doherty.co.uk/blog/the-benefits-of-a-password-manager/)**: I recently started using 1Password, and I cannot fathom the fact that I used to manage passwords manually â€“ trying to remember unique patterns and constantly resetting them.
Not only does 1Password sort all of my passwords I can use it to store confidential documents and it syncs effortlessly across my iOS, Windows, macOS, and Android devices. While I chose 1Password, any reputable password manager is worth the investment.
3. **[An electric toothbrush](https://amzn.eu/d/bz2FGw3)**: Electric `>>>` manual. I'm sorry I ever doubted a robotic piece of machinery to match the precision I could achieve manually. This was an industrial revolution vs the stone age moment for me. My teeth feel cleaner and whiter. My only regret is being a skeptic and going for the entry level cheapest brush and not splurging a bit of extra cash into trying to get a better more robust toothbrush but we move.
4. **[Loop earbuds / Noise cancelling ear plugs](https://amzn.eu/d/fbGLNKc)**: I decided to switch from constantly listening to coding playlists or music while working to using plain noise-cancelling ear plugs. In doing so, Iâ€™ve stripped away the last bit of joy in my life, leaving it as bland as chewing cardboard.
But itâ€™s not all bad â€“ I think Iâ€™ve slightly expanded my attention span, improved focus and feel more present. These ear plugs help reduce noise, not to an extreme level, but enough that I notice the difference when Iâ€™m not using them.
5. **[A really good work chair](https://amzn.eu/d/fMjre2s)**: This purchase genuinely blew my mind â€“ so much so that I ended up buying a quality chair for every member of my family. I had no idea how much of a difference a good chair could make to my workflow. At first, I tried to cheap out (like I did with the toothbrush) and bought the cheapest chair I could find on Amazon. Naturally, it broke in no time. After that, I decided to invest around Â£100 in a better chair, and I havenâ€™t stopped raving about it since. Itâ€™s made a noticeable difference to my productivity, and my back is already thanking me. I've converted at least 3 people to switching their chairs and they all call me Rabbi now cause it has changed their life.
6. **[Multiport charger](https://amzn.eu/d/jhStDY7)**: Stops me from trying to haggle charging ports for multiple devices. Really makes life easier and I don't have to struggle trying to find endless charging ports for the plethora of devices that always seem to be running out of juice ðŸ¥¤.
7. **[Keyboard & mouse rest](https://amzn.eu/d/9BAIaUT)**: Carpel Tunnel Syndrome is very real so do your wrists a favor and get it some cushioning. Your future self will thank you, and youâ€™ll be able to spend more time passionately arguing on the internet instead of going outside and touching grass.
