Back in 2022 I happened to stumble on a PDF of the book **[The Daily Stoic](https://g.co/kgs/rLQM73M)** by Ryan Holiday. The book was structured such that it gave you a new meditation for each new day. I had this PDF on my desktop but sometimes I would lose the page I was on or just forget to read the day's meditation<br/><br/>

At that time I was just diving into React, and I found myself stuck in tutorial hell building something that I didn't really enjoy building, so I had an idea, and decided to embark on this little side-project. I decided I'd build an application which would just gave me the quote for the day from the book based on the day it was, something that would make this tiny problem I had go away.

Initially, I thought it would do just that, but the moment I got building it, I realised that I could embed more stoic bits into the application. Which lead me down spirals of trying to figure how to make it all work, so not only was I learning React in a more hands-on way, having fun, I was also tackling bits that I wouldn't necessarily have picked up in some coding tutorials.

Then, I launched it, used it vigorously, shared it amongst friends, promoted it on the internet and then life happened.

I got busy with work, and there wasn't any time to really build something on the side, plus who cares about your dumb little side project anyway so my side project lay on the side without much care into how it was doing.

But then one fine day, I received this email:

There was a bug in my app and this person who uses the app reached out to me and in that moment where some other being found your silly little idea useful was truly wholesome. I remember dropping everything and focusing on just fixing the bug so that this user from Paraguay could go about his daily meditation being served on my app.

**What is the point I'm trying to make?**
Your ideas are not dumb, there's probably a niche of people out there who find what you build truly useful. Just the whole concept of creation benefited me in learning this new tool I was trying to pick up, solving a daily problem I faced, making life easier for me and in the process, also making life easier for more people you'll never meet.

So I think it's imperative if you posses the skill to build something that you should actively involve yourself in building something not necessarily cool or fancy or something that would benefit other people but build something for you.

Additionally with the shackles of monotonous work, I feel side projects help sharpen your skillset, keep upto-date with what's out there and give you a playing ground to do cool things.

"Ya man that's cool and all, but I ain't got the time for all that, I got too much on my plate already"

I've been a victim of this myself thinking I'm slogging my ass at work already and that's me working on my skills anyway, so why take this extra time to build something else? I don't really have an answer to that to be honest, but there is an inexplicable joy in having the ability to create something from the ground-up, mould it by your vision and something that YOU have complete control over. Not your manager, the stakeholders, company targets, your partner NADA, it's all YOU! You are the artist and I think that's really beautiful in a special way!

TLDR: Build some cool shit, find time to build things you'll use and put it out there, if someone else find's it useful it's cool but if not it was built just for you in the first place!
